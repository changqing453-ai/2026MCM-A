People are constantly plagued by the unpredictability of smartphone battery life: the same device might last a full day one time, yet run out before lunchtime the next. To better understand these fluctuations, we built a continuous-time, temperature-coupled SOC framework based on publicly available smartphone test datasets. This framework analyzes how the screen, CPU, wireless networks (Wi-Fi/4G/5G), GPS, background services, and ambient temperature drive SOC changes across different scenarios.
First, we time-aligned multi-source time series, removed duplicates and outliers, smoothed high-frequency noise with short-window filtering, and normalized the data. Based on this, we created correlation heatmaps, bin-based contour plots, and 3D bin-based surface plots to visually illustrate relationships between data points. This revealed that screen display and computational load are the primary contributors to system energy consumption.
Model 1 (Mechanism Layer) Total power consumption is represented as the sum of seven key metrics. Constrained least squares estimation was used to determine specific parameters. For the nonlinear CPU component, an exponential factor (\gamma) was selected via grid search, ultimately setting (\gamma=3.0) to minimize fitting error. These parameters quantify each module's impact on power consumption. For instance, wireless network coefficients exhibit an increasing relationship: (p_{WiFi}=0.0666), (p_{4G}=0.0991), (p_{5G}=0.1077). The high-power CPU term is (p_{\text{c1}}=1.3149).
Model 2 (Physical Layer) We incorporate temperature effects into the SOC dynamics: separately modeling the impact of temperatures above/below the reference temperature on power dissipation rates. The reference temperature is determined via grid search, while other temperature coefficients are fitted using constrained regression; the optimal result is 16.7981°C.
Next, we establish a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) for SOC using the total power consumption model and temperature effects. We advance SOC using explicit Euler methods, ensuring physical feasibility through non-negativity constraints, and refine the depletion time via linear interpolation when SOC crosses zero. Simultaneously, we present an efficient TTE calculation method combining discrete cumulative summation and interpolation, thereby deriving the SOC–TTE curve.
Building upon the established total power consumption model, we constructed ten representative usage scenarios. For each mode, we calculated TTE and component power consumption shares according to the formula. The results revealed that “rapid power-down” is primarily driven by 5G communication and GPS positioning functions, while background power consumption exhibits a significant cumulative impact in low-user-interaction scenarios (e.g., music playback, standby).
Third, we performed OAT sensitivity analysis: sequentially applying negative perturbations to parameters and ranking them using (\Delta P_{\mathrm{eff}}) to identify critical parameters requiring priority calibration. Results demonstrate the model's robust accuracy and resilience across diverse scenarios.
Finally, we introduced exponential aging factors correlated with calendar time and cumulative energy flux. Aging scenario curves demonstrate that more severe aging systematically reduces endurance at the same SOC, indicating that runtime TTE estimation and control thresholds should adaptively update with battery aging.
